A web app I wrote that allows users to collect and keep track of every day in the year. This process of writing notes everyday is based on Matthew Dicks book [`Storyworthy`](https://matthewdicks.com/Books/storyworthy/), this is meant be used to improve 
retelling of events through by noting small chunks of our day, to help us notice and reflect the smaller fine details in life.
